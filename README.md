## Hello! I'm Marie 👋

I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree in Actuarial Science** at the University of Gustave Eiffel, driven by a passion for numbers, risk modeling, and data analysis. With a strong foundation in **Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science**, I have a particular interest in applying these disciplines to solve complex financial and actuarial problems.

## 🎓 Education

- **Master's in Actuarial Science** – Gustave Eiffel University (current)
- **Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science Applied to Human and Social Sciences (MIASHS)** – University of Bordeaux  
- **Exchange Program** – Actuarial Mathematics & English at a university in South Korea (2022)

## 💼 Professional Experience

I completed my **first year of the Master's program** in a work-study arrangement at **FRAERIS**, where I worked on concrete projects related to:

- **Risk assessment**  
- **Data analysis**  
- **Stochastic modeling**  
- **Portfolio management**

This experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, sharpening my technical skills and deepening my understanding of the actuarial field.

## 🔧 Skills

- **Programming & Data Analysis**: Python, R, Excel  
- **Mathematical Models & Stochastic Processes**  
- **Risk Management & Actuarial Calculations**  
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Models**  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau

## 🌍 Languages

- **French** (native)  
- **English** (fluent)

## 💡 Projects

Here you can find some of the projects I have worked on, ranging from stochastic models to risk assessment algorithms. Each project highlights different aspects of actuarial science and data analysis, with a focus on **practical application** and **problem-solving**.
